# Testing Log Statuses

This article is a test for the custom log status shortcodes that display different status colors for logs. Below are the various states you can use:

## Logs in Progress

{{< logstatus status="in-progress" >}}

## Logs Achieved

{{< logstatus status="achieved" >}}

## Logs Dropped

{{< logstatus status="dropped" >}}

## Unknown Status

{{< logstatus status="unknown" >}}

---

By using this shortcode, we can easily track the status of different tasks or logs in a visually appealing way!
